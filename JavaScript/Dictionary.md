Dynamic:  the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime.

First-class: functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

Hoisting: moved to the top of the scope during compilation.

Prototype-based: no need of a class to create an object.

Temporal dead zone (TDZ): from the start of the block until code execution reaches the place where the variable is declared and initialized.
